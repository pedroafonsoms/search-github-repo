A simple project with the purpose of showing the use of **Unit**, **Widget** and **Integration Tests** (e2e) for projects built in Flutter.

## Setup

I recommend you following instructions in installation documentation of Flutter ([link](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)). Follow instructions where you run `flutter doctor` to know if your setup is done.

## How to run tests

With your configuration done, we can run our tests.

To run Unit and Widget tests, run commando below:
```
flutter test
```

To run Integration Tests (E2E tests), run commando below:
```
flutter test integration_test -d <EMULATOR-OR-SIMULATOR-NAME>
```
